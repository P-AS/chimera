/* compile_sessions.h - how many compile sessions a machine can run at once.
 *
 * A core that recompiles can fill its cache before a game first runs: the
 * frontend starts several sessions side by side, each compiling a share
 * (docs/compile-cache.md). How many is a question about memory, and it was
 * answered wrongly twice.
 *
 * WHAT A SESSION COSTS (measured, Windows, chimera issue 259). One session
 * compiling a PlayStation 3 game holds about 7 GB: four of them took 25.8 GB
 * of the system's commit within 80 seconds of starting and 27.9 GB at their
 * peak. Of that only 1.6 to 1.75 GB is the process's private memory, which is
 * the figure the old sizing was made from (4 GB a session "with a wide
 * margin"). The rest is the sandbox's memory: sections backed by the page
 * file, which a process's private bytes do not count and a job object's limit
 * does not see. So the figure here is 8 GB.
 *
 * WHAT A MACHINE HAS TO GIVE. On Windows every one of those bytes has to be
 * promised by the system before it is used ("commit"), and the promise is
 * limited by memory plus the page file, not by memory that happens to be
 * free. Asked for more than it has, Windows makes the page file bigger -
 * which is on the system drive whatever folder the frontend keeps its data
 * in - and when the drive is full the sessions die. That is what the report
 * was: seven sessions on a machine sized by its free memory, 18.8 GB gone
 * from C: in the course of one compile, and every session dead at the end.
 * So what a Windows machine can spare is the smaller of its free memory and
 * of what it can still promise with the page file as big as it is now.
